# gepapy

The objective of this project is to develop a library that allows to solve various production planning problems in a flexible and fast way by means of modules that the user can configure and join to create their own implementations; Each module is implemented in cuda and runs directly on the GPU with the help of the numba and cupy libraries, which guarantees a parallel execution and much shorter waiting times than if the execution were done on the CPU.
